# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post written in **Markdown**! 

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is:
- Simple to write
- Easy to read
- Portable (just plain text files)
- Universally supported

## How It Works

I write my posts in Markdown files, place them in the `src/content/posts/` folder, and the site automatically processes them. No database needed!

### Code Example

```javascript
// Here's some code
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next

More posts coming soon! Stay tuned for updates on:
- Technology topics
- Learning experiences
- Personal projects
